# Auth0 Angular Pizza42 application - Paul Volosen - 

This projects implements a 'Pizza4' project. The sample uses AUTH0 and the Angular CLI. The app is configured to connect to paulvoax.auth0.com

## Getting Started

Download the project and execute the following commands. Note: googleapis and Pizza42Server MUST be in separate folders.
```bash
npm install 
```

## Run the Application

The development server that comes with the Angular CLI can be used to serve the application.

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Note:** The default Angular CLI port is `4200`, but Auth0 samples use port `3000` instead.

## Run the Application With Docker

In order to run the example with docker you need to have `docker` installed.

You also need to set the environment variables as explained [previously](#set-the-client-id-domain-and-api-url).

Execute in command line `sh exec.sh` to run the Docker in Linux, or `.\exec.ps1` to run the Docker in Windows.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
